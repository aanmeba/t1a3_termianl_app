# T1A3 - Terminal Application

## Source Control Repository
[repo](https://github.com/aanmeba/t1a3_termianl_app)

## Software Development Plan

This terminal application is for splitting the bills. 

## Features

Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

--------------------------

## Festures
- Take inputs, users' names and total amount to split
- give options, dividing it equally or randomly
- display the list of names with the amount to owe respectively

## Extra features
- set a maximum amount for the result for the sake of everyone's financial status...

### Even further...
- assuming that this app is for a specific cafe, import a menu file including menu names and prices
- give options whether they want to split the whole bill (that will be the basic app) or just the shared menus (only drinks will be charged individually, and the total of other food will be divided)
- give options, dividing it equally or randomly

## User interaction & experience

Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

## Control flow

Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.

## Implementation Plan -> Trello

Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

## How to install and use

Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
